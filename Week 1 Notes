TypeSystem
No Characters in python/No arrays in python
"" or ''= String
camelcasing = lower first letter uper secod word
Command: type([varible])
Command: int([variable]) | displays integer of a sring, data type doesn't change
Command: [varible] = int([variable])
add stinges to concatate them, cannot maths two diffent variable
division // doesn't round.. just cuts off
LISTS
Command: myList = []
Command ex: myList = [1, "two", ['three', 'four']]
Command: myList [2]
Command: myList [-1] | last in list
potential error: IndexError: list index out of range | refrenced location doens't exist

Mutable data types: Lists and Dictionary, all other data types get a new space in memory
Command: id(variable)

Remove from list
del myList[Loc]

Methods
.append only works for lists
.pop be carful | takes away last item in list
Command: [varible] = myList.pop() | takes removed item and puts in it's own varible
.split('') to sepeate a string into a list by the delimeter(ususally a space) does not save anywhere
Command ex: myStr.split(',') | seperates by comma
typecasting to a list sets seperated  by letter
''.join to concate a string into one word
Command ex: ''.join(myWord)


TUPL s list you cannot modify
Command ex: myTup = ('stuck', 'here', 'forever')
This can only be typecasted to a list
Command ex: list(myTup)

String Minipulation??
Concatation
ex: name = 'King'
    'My Name is ' + name
.format insert variable in {} <- is placeholder
ex: 'My name is {}'.format(name)
in .format() using multiple placeholders, insert the varibles in the order they appear, comma specrated
ex: PI = 3.14159265359
    'Pi = {:.2f}' .format (PI)
    : = activate
    . = pull after decimal
    2f is the amount to pull after decimal

Can specify seperators
Command ex: print(a, b, sep=":")

Command ex: print a, b, sep=":", end="and thats the end")


input takes input and always returns a string
Command ex: input ("Type Something")
Command ex: int(input())





Modulus Remainder


Scripting Activity ex Answer:
email = 'monty@python.grail'

print('.'.join(email.slpit('@')).split('.'))

REPL
email = 'monty@python.grail'
email = email.split('@')
email = '.'.join(email)
email = email.split('.')








if
Instructor ex:
  user = unput()
  
  if user == 'print':
     print('print')


elif
